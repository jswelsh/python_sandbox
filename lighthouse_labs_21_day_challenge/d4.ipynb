    "Day Four: for loops\n",
    "Dot's now happily mapped out exactly what supplies they'll need to make the repairs to their new rural abode. They're nearly breathless with anticipation, thinking about how incredible it's going to look! But first, they need to buy the paint and wood. There's so much Dot needs to purchase, they're unsure - should they buy the items at normal retail value, or wholesale?\n",

    "In this challenge, you'll need to use a for loop to reach the answer. In programming, a loop is a block of code that's executed repeatedly, either for a set number of times, or until a certain condition is met. A for loop is a loop that is executed for a set number of times, iterated over the number of items in a sequence. To learn more about for loops, read this article.\n",
