    "Day 9: pandas data cleaning & filling NaNs\n",
    "Dot understands how cows work a bit more now. They got themselves really hyped up to rent a cow, and traversed down the road to the cow farm. Dot spent some time negotiating with the cow farmer how much it would be to rent a cow, then went over to take a look at the beasts and pick a favourite.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examining the moo-ing creatures, a realization slowly sinks in. If Dot did rent out a cow, they would definitely get attached to it over the month. Having to give it back to the farmer would be heartbreaking! They think back to their youth, when they briefly took care of a friend's plankton. Giving the plankton back was one of the saddest moments of their life.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maybe Dot isn't thinking big enough. What if they took a leap and bought an entire cow - would it be worth it? How much milk would they get out of it?\n",
    "\n",
    "Tutorial\n",
    "Many people who work heavily with data would agree that a lot of time is spent on data cleaning, and only a little on actually running models or analyzing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data cleaning consists of many different tasks, like handling missing data, reshaping data, and creating new data based on the given data (referred to as feature engineering).\n",
    "\n",
    "For today's challenge we'll be looking at different methods for dealing with missing values, and we'll be using pandas to help us with basic data cleaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The equation for filling in missing values:\n",
    "\n",
    "df['column_name'] = df['column_name'].fillna(value = 100)\n",
    "\n",
    "df['column_name'] = df['column_name'].fillna(method = 'backfill')\n",
    "Before you move forward, take a moment to reflect on these questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "How would filling our missing data with the median value vs. the mean value affect the distribution of our data?\n",
    "\n",
    "Look up the .fillna function in the pandas documentation, and find some different filling methods we could implement. What are they?\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's import our new data."
