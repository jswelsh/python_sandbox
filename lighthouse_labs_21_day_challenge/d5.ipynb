    "Day 5: conditional logic and control flows\n",
    "After purchasing all the supplies they needed to make repairs, Dot's house is starting to look incredible. The floors are patched, and the rooms are painted to perfection. Now all they need is to give the house a good thorough cleaning. The bad news is that the box with their cleaning supplies seems to have been misplaced in the move.\n",
    "\n",
    "The store in the nearby town does sell cleaning supplies, but their prices can sometimes be a lot higher than Dot's used to. They've already spent so much money on repairs - can you help them figure out which supplies to abstain from buying at the town's store?\n",

    "Tutorial:\n",
    "In today's challenge, you'll use two essential programming concepts: conditional logic and control flows.\n",

    "Conditional Logic:\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional logic refers to the execution of different actions based on whether a certain condition is met. In programming, these conditions are expressed by a set of symbols called Boolean Operators.\n",

    ">\tx > y\tx is greater than y\n",
    ">=\tx >= y\tx is greater than or equal to y\n",

    "<=\tx <= y\tx is less than or equal to y\n",
    "!=\tx != y\tx is not equal to y\n",
    "==\tx == y\tx is equal to y\n",
    "Conditional logic is essential to control flow statements. In programming, control flows are expressed in if...else statments. To read more on if...else statements, read this article before proceeding.\n",

    "Using Python, develop a list of items that are too expensive for Dot to purchase at the nearby store."
