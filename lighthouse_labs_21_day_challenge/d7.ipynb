    "Day Seven: simple functions and data cleaning\n",
    "Everything in Dot's new house is finally coming together now! The repairs are finished, and the cleaning's done. But the house wonâ€™t feel like a home until Dot finishes unpacking all their belongings. The problem is, the way things are organized is so chaotic that every time Dot approaches the pile of their boxes, they get overwhelmed and run away to continue procrastinating.\n",

    "In today's challenge you'll use another essential programming concept: functions. In the previous challenges and tutorials you've already encountered certain functions, like range(), len(), round(), and print(). However, those functions are already pre-defined, built-in to Python itself. Today, you'll learn how to create your own functions. Before proceeding, try reading this article on functions.\n",
